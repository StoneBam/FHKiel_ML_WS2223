# Polygons CNN

Target of this subfolder is to use a CNN for classification purposes.
I decided to classify polygons with the [polygons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gonzalorecioc/color-polygon-images) from kaggle.

The first approach is done with instructions from the book [Deep learning mit Python und Keras](https://www.mitp.de/IT-WEB/Programmierung/Deep-Learning-mit-Python-und-Keras.html).
Second approach was with [tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)
