# Purpose

This is my repository for educational purposes of the Machine Learning Module at FH-Kiel.
The code is and will in no way or form ever be perfect, performant, beautiful or even final. It is build for weekly assignments with varying complexity and time to spare.
Feel free to use the issue tool, to ask questions or drop ideas.

## Build 'Modules'

- Linear regression approximation
- k-mean clustering
